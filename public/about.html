  My first programming course was done at MIIt Aba where i learnt how to develop a website
  using Dreamweaver. i was able to host my first site. There are lots of defficiency
  using Dreamweaver therefore I have to register a fresh course with Andela with Google. I took
  lots of tutorials online from W3 school, tutorialpoint and lot more.

  a course on digital marketing with Google.

  Software Engineering course with ALX.
